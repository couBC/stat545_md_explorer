This worksheet is a condensed version of Jenny's stat545.com functions [part1](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-01.html), [part2](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-02.html), and [part3](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-03.html).

## Syntax Demo

Let's demo the syntax of function-making.

```{r}
square <- function(x) {
  y <- x^2
  y
  return(y)
  5
}

square(10)

#and that's a function/how you write a function :D

#{} how to write a bunch of code but only return a single output
#the "return" is the instruction as the last line that the function will read, anything after that is ignored, e.g., the 5 is ignored

```

## Motivating example: max minus min.

Find the max minus min of the gapminder life expectancy:

```{r}
?max
?min
min(gapminder$lifeExp)
max(gapminder$lifeExp)
max(gapminder$lifeExp) - min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

```{r}
max(c(1,3,4))
#is a vector length 3

max(1,3,4)
#is 3 vectors length 1

#also 
max(c(1,3,4), c(2,1,2))

pmax(c(1,3,4), c(2, 1, 2))
```


Exercise: turn this into a function! i.e., write a function that returns the max minus min of a vector. Try it out on the gapminder variables.

```{r}
max_minus_min <- function(x) {
  max(x) - min(x)
}

max_minus_min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

We'll be building on this. Development philosophy [widely attributed to the Spotify development team](http://blog.fastmonkeys.com/?utm_content=bufferc2d6e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer):

## Testing

Check your function using your own eyeballs:

- Apply to the vector 1:10. Do you get the intended result?
- Apply to a random uniform vector. Do you get meaningful results?
- Helps with de-bugging and catching errors. 

```{r}
max_minus_min(1:10)
max_minus_min(runif(100))
#runif = uniform random numbers generates x numbers between 0 and 1
```

Let's formalize this testing with the `testthat` package. `expect_*()` functions:

```{r}
expect_equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
#doesn't return anything if it is true
expect_identical(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
#expect identical is stricter than expect_equal
```

Add another check to the following unit test, based on the uniform random numbers:

```{r}
test_that("Simple cases work", {
    expect_equal(max_minus_min(1:10), 9)
    expect_lt(max_minus_min(runif(100)), 1)
})

#no news is good news, so no output, passed the test

#also this would work but instructor recommends the above method
  expect_equal(max_minus_min(1:10), 9)
  expect_lt(max_minus_min(runif(100)), 1)
```


```{r}
test_that("Simple cases work", {
    expect_equal(max_minus_min(1:10), 9)
    expect_lt(max_minus_min(runif(100)), 0.5)
})

#0.5 would not work

```

## Try and break your function

Because you will eventually forget the function specifics.

```{r}
max_minus_min(numeric(0))
max_minus_min(gapminder)
max_minus_min(gapminder$country)
#none of these work - shows the boundaries of the function

```

These don't break! But they don't work

```{r}
max_minus_min(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
#gives an answer but is not meaningful
max_minus_min(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
#trues and falses are coerced into 0s and 1's therefore gives you an answer of "1"
```

We want:

1. Prevent the latter cases from happening, and
2. Make a more informative error message in the former.

Check out `stopifnot` and `stop`:

```{r}
stopifnot(FALSE)
stop("Here's my little error message.")
```

Your turn:  Use two methods:

1. Using `stopifnot`, modify the max-min function to throw an error if an input is not numeric (the `is.numeric` function is useful).

```{r}
mmm1 <- function(x) {
    stopifnot(!is.numeric(x))
    max(x) - min(x)
}

mmm1("hello")

#stopifnot is hard to think about - double negative ... try stop 
```

Stop is for adding arguments to your function, test_that is to test the function. Best to write your test_that before you write the function because then you have a good idea what the function you are creating is going to to do.

2. Using `stop` and an `if` statement, Modify the max-min function to:
    - throw an error if an input is not numeric. In the error message, indicate what's expected as an argument, and what was recieved. 
    - return `NULL` if the input is length-0, with a warning using the `warning` function.

```{r}
mmm2 <- function(x) {
    if (!is.numeric(x)) {
        stop(paste("Expecting x to be numeric. You gave me", 
                   typeof(x)))
    }
    max(x) - min(x)
}
```

Try breaking the function now:

```{r}
mmm1((numeric(0)))
mmm1(gapminder)
mmm1(gapminder$country)
mmm1(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
mmm1(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

mmm2((numeric(0)))
mmm2(gapminder)
mmm2(gapminder$country)
mmm2(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
mmm2(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

## Naming, and generalizing to quantile difference

```{r}
z <- 1:10
mmm2(x)
#x is a dummy variable, don't need to call input x (in this case I called it z)
```


Let's generalize the function to take the difference in two quantiles:

Quantile of 0.9 for example, you have a 90% chance of drawing a number that's smaller than 90

```{r}
quantile(rnorm(100))
```


```{r}
qd <- function(x, probs) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
```

Try it out:

```{r}
x <- runif(100)
qd(x, c(0.25, 0.75))
IQR(x)
qd(x, c(0,1))
mmm2(x)

#IQR is the length of the box in a boxplot
```

Why did I call the arguments `x` and `probs`? Check out `?quantile`. 

If we input a vector stored in some variable, need that variable be named `x`?

## Defaults

Would be nice to have defaults for `probs`, right? Add them to the below code (which is copied and pasted from above):


```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1)) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}

qd2(rnorm(100), probs=c(0.25, 0.75))
```

## NA handling

Does this return what we were expecting?

```{r}
(v <- c(1:10, NA))
qd(v)
```

Notice that `quantile()` has a `na.rm` option. Let's use it in our `qd` function. Modify the code below:

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1)) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}

#Na.rm =TRUE is good for starting your analysis, use Na.rm = FALSE when doing imputation
```

## Ellipses

There are other arguments to `quantile`, like `type`, that are not used all that much. Put them in as ellipses:

"..." in R means you can put any number of arguments

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1), na.rm=FALSE, ...) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, ...)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
```

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1), na.rm=FALSE, ...) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, ...)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
v <- rnorm(100)
qd2(v, probs=c(0,1), na.rm = TRUE, 1)
```
